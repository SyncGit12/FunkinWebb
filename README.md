# Funkin' Web

Have you ever wanted to play FNF on the internet? But Newgrounds's UI does not let you make in fullscreen?

And you are in a PC that Null Object References you?

Well, we introduce FUNKIN' WEB!

Honestly shoutout to the Funkin' Crew for making this full-ass game

## Features

- Chart and Stage editor!
- Ghost tapping!
- Not lagging in any moment! (note of the creator: i haven't tested it yet)

And of course,

- It's web!

The website will update when the game updates!
